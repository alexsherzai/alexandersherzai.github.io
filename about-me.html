            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Alexander Sherzai! I am 18 years old, and a senior undergradate student of Computer Science at California State University, specializing in Data Science and Applied Machine Learning.
                As a prospective PhD and masters student, I'm doing research and gaining experience in the field of data science and machine learning. 
                My various technical <a href = '#skills'>skills</a> and leadership ability have allowed me to further a myriad of <a href = '#projects'>projects</a> and <a href = '#research'>publications</a>.
                Some of my fields of research interest include machine learning in biotechnology, data science in public health, natural language processing and cognitive computing.
                I have experience with dozens of programming languages, multiple machine learning frameworks (i.e. tensorflow, pytorch, keras) and have public speaking and leadership experience necessary for team building.
